Given limited fiscal space and implementation capacity, it is critical to ensure that the World Bank portfolio be well targeted both among intervention areas and to geographic locations with the greatest potential to achieve the Bank's aims. Accordingly, using evidence to inform the spatial allocation of Bank projects can increase their cost effectiveness in achieving the Bank's objectives.

One way to guide the geographic prioritization of Bank interventions is through a composite, geographic targeting index called the Project Targeting Index (PTI). A PTI can be used to better understand which locations within a given country or region may need to be prioritized (and de-prioritized) given certain objective, data-driven criteria. A composite index combines indicators of a number of criteria in a transparent manner to highlight where potential impact or need is greatest.

This online geospatial portal offers a user-friendly tool for the construction of the PTI based on a wide range of indicators related to poverty, human capital, labor, etc.
